# Horzion
program for Horizon instrument

This is a macro for SolidEdge.  
It will check the current file type and save the file with a new type.  
For file with ".dft", the program will save it as ".pdf" and ".dwg".   
For file with ".par" or ".asm", the program will save it as ".igs" and ".stp".  
Note that "Easy Save as" is the final result. Others are prototype.
